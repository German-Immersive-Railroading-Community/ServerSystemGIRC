## Config
The config can be found at `/plugins/serversystem/plugin.yml` in your server folder.

### Disable join- and leavemessage
You have the oportunity to disable the join- and leavemessage if you don't want to have minecraft's default join- and leavemessage.

```json
Server:
  joinmessage: false
  leavemessage: false
```

### Tablist text
You can add text above and below the names of the players in the tablist.

```json
Server:
  tablist:
    title:
      text: Welcome
      color: blue
    subtitle:
      text: to this server!
      color: dark_green
```

You can use the colors codes listed in the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes#Color_codes "Color Codes").

### Lobby
You can set the lobby as main world of teh server. You can go back by `/lobby` if you have this enabled and if a user is connecting to the server, he will be spawn at the lobby world.

```json
Server:
  lobby: true
  lobbyworld: world
```

### Enable WorldGroups
If you want to use multible worlds with different inventories and spawn locations, you can use the WorldGroup-System. It works simular to the plugin MultiWorld. You can enable this feature in the here:

```json
Server:
  enableworldgroups: true
```

Every world, which is loaded has a configuration section. There can the option `group` be found. Worlds are in one worldgroup if they have the same group name. When a player switch to a world in the same worldgroup, he will keep his inventory and levels. If the world have a groupname, which no other world have, then the world is alone in a worldgroup and have a separated inventory and experience level.

```json
world:
    group: world
world_nether:
    group: world
hogwarts:
    group: hogwarts
```

In this example world and world_nether are in the same worldgroup while the world hogwarts has his own separated worldgroup.

### Disable commands and default permissions
You can disable permissions simply by adding the permission to the list. For example, you can disable minecraft default commands by adding its permission.

```json
DisabledPermissions:
- bukkit.command.version
- bukkit.command.plugins
- bukkit.command.help
```

You can find minecraft standard commands in the [Bukkit Wiki](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/CraftBukkit_Commands "Commands").

### Load worlds
You can load other worlds to your server, if there in your server directory. You can add a new world just by adding the world to the list. The world 'world' and the subworlds 'world_nether' and 'world_the_end' are loaded by default. You can change the default world in the file `server.properties`.

```json
Worldload:
- hogwarts
```

### Groups [until v2.1]
The plugin have a permission system. A group have a name, a parent and permissions as a list. If you don't want do use this add nothing to the groups. A group get also all permissions from it's parent.

```json
Groups:
  player: ''
  moderator:
    id: 02RankModerator
    color: dark_blue
    prefix: '[Moderator] '  
    permissions:
    - serversystem.command.permission
    - minecraft.command.*
  admin:
    id: 01RankAdmin
    color: dark_red
    prefix: '[Admin] '
    parent: moderator
    permissions:
    - minecraft.command.op
    - serversystem.command.*
    - bukkit.command.*
```

The id of the group is unimportant except for the number in front of the name. The number defines the order of the player in the tabbar. The Rank `04RankSupporter` will be displayed below the `01RankAdmin` but above the `06RankPremium` for example. Make sure you have an empty space after the prefix, otherwise the prefix will be displayed directly in front of the player's name. You can find an example for the tabbar at the end of the document as image.

You can use the colors codes listed in the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes#Color_codes "Color Codes").

You can add a group to the players in the player section. 

```json
Players:
  8e1f0a29-7279-412d-a6a6-4266164d6a87:
    name: Der_Zauberer
    group: admin

```
